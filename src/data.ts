👋 Hey there!

🚀 I am a software developer currently studying Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, with a passion for exploring the world of tech and engineering. I have nearly 2 years of professional experience developing full-stack web apps, GUI applications, and control systems software, gained through five diverse internships.

💻 I am proficient in Python, C++, C, and TypeScript, as well as web development tools like React, Redux, Node.js, and Express.js. I'm excited to bring my skills to an internship role and continue growing as a developer.

🏊‍♂️ Outside of school and work, I enjoy swimming as a member of the Waterloo varsity swim team, and I love traveling and exploring new places. I am committed to continuous learning and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
